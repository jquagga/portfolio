There are have been a lot of changes recently to the composition of the US Federal government. With potential layoffs, I had several friends in different agencies asking how many people were in the same job class in their agency. [OPM provides the overall data in their fedcube](https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/) and I wrote a simple python script (anonymously) which compiled the raw csv files into a pandas dataframe and produced Excel files for each agency and sub-agency. That allowed individuals who may not work with data often a easier way to figure out where they might stand in terms of tenure.

The data is fascinating and I'm currently working on a Tableau with some additional insights as I discover new information.

Github has the repository as [fedscope-excel](https://github.com/pythonicfed/fedscope-excel).
