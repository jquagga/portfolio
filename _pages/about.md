Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm told that it is good practice for data analysts to keep a [portfolio](/portfolio/) of some of their projects in order to demonstrate their skills. The link above should allow you to view several projects I've been working on and I will add more as I build more out. If you're interested in talking, feel free to reach out with email or on LinkedIn.

See you out there!
